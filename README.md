## Bad User Interfaces (1)

### Government of Canada Website

There are two key flaws in the design of the application interface on the Government of Canada's website. First, when you click through to a page you need to apply for, the site has a lot of text to get the user confused, but probably a lot of detail because of the importance of the documents the government is applying for, but this will confuse the user and make the user encounter many obstacles when they are applying. Secondly, the key application process lacks clear progression prompts, uses ambiguous options, and has no step-by-step guidance. Like when I once applied for a renewal study permit, but I ended up applying for a different weird visa because of the vague guidance, and usually by the time the user realizes it, usually 2-3 months have passed. This kind of confusing design erodes trust in Canadian government services, and I think due to this importance, the platforms should focus more on having user-centred design principles. The official website has also caused me to pay extra costs to someone who is experienced to apply for me because of the complexity of its website and application and the lack of clear progress alerts in the application process.

## Bad User Interfaces (2)

### Gosfu

The gosfu website's UI design significantly hinders user experience due to poor layout optimization and accessibility issues. Buttons are often excessively small and clustered, creating navigation challenges, while the underutilized right-side whitespace highlights inefficient visual hierarchy and wasted screen real estate. These design flaws, compounded by frequent connectivity disruptions, frustrate students attempting to access time-sensitive academic resources, ultimately undermining the platform's functionality and reliability. Prioritizing intuitive button placement, responsive scaling, and balanced page composition could dramatically improve usability.

## Good User Interfaces (1)

### Apple Website

Apple’s website is one of my favorite user interfaces. The main reason is attribute by its simplicity and claity. The main page highlight apple’s newest product, make the customers can quickly know the company's latest technological advances. The top navigation bar categorizes products effectively, make it easy for potential customers to find the interested products. This user-friendly interface greatly enhances the user experience and form a favorable impression of the company. In contrast, companies that ignore these design elements tend to frustrate potential customers with cumbersome navigation, which diminishes their appeal. Another aspect of Apple's website that I appreciate is its aesthetic design. When you click on a product of interest, you'll see detailed information about its latest features, complemented by high-quality videos and compelling photos. In addition, at the bottom of the page, you'll find a comparison chart of the latest product to different models in the same series, presented in a clear and organized table. Also, the design of the buttons and font on the page is tied to Apple's culture and products. Make users feel the design's clever and elegant.

## Good User Interfaces (2)

### Notion

Notion is also one of my very favorite user interfaces, a productivity tool that takes the concept of modularity to the extreme and reimagines document tools through the concept of modularity. Unlike traditional document tools like Word and Google Docs that are stacked with features, Notion makes the interface disappear to create a “zero-distraction” creation environment. The top toolbar is streamlined into a page title, leaving almost the whole page of the screen space for the content body. This “content-first” layout allows user to focus on themselves rather than the tools. This kind of UI design is often preferred by users that want to be focus on the content, because it makes the whole page minimalist. Notion uses the design concept of Block, each paragraph, table or multimedia element is an independently manipulated Block, which supports any kinds of arrangement, switching format templates, and building a library of modules that can be used across pages. On the aspect of efficiency, type “/” to use the various functions, and in the use of their own shortcuts can be set up after a lot faster than traditional document tools. This design makes Notion reach the “transparency” of the tool, this convenient and beautiful UI design is what many users expect.

## AI-based User Interfaces (1)

### Quark

Quark is an AI-based browser in China that effectively uses AI to enhance its user experience. Quark's interface uses AI technology to quickly respond to user requests, which cuts down on waiting time and increases work efficiency. This is especially useful for tasks that require frequent interactions, like customer support, data analysis, or content creation. Second, Quark's interface is very simple. You only need to take a few steps to complete everyday chores, making it faster and easier to use than regular browsers for work and studying. It also lets users adjust different Mini Apps to match their personal choices, like real-time translation and grammar checking, which improves the browser's flexibility and personalization. AI models are trained on past data, so if that data includes biases or unfair information, the AI can continue to spread discrimination and unfairness in some of its actions. Also, users who depend too much on AI for making decisions or handling problems might slowly lose their critical thinking and job skills. This can lead to major problems when AI gives wrong or unclear information.

## AI-based User Interfaces (2)

### Baidu AI Health

![6315af21ae30816779304e8751f3dad](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ef16ddc-4d0f-4cb4-afb8-b5d71879f455)

Baidu AI Health is Baidu's AI database for the medical field, which is used to identify users based on the symptoms they provide. It focuses on making its user interface accessible. This includes features like voice assistants, screen readers, and text-to-speech, allowing visually impaired, hearing impaired, and other disabled people to receive medical information equally. This easy-to-use design, along with AI's quick responses, allows people everywhere to get health advice anytime and anywhere. Collecting data can lead to privacy risks because the system learns more about the user's health, symptoms, and personal choices. Improper use, sharing, or unauthorized access to user information can lead to major problems. Also, in areas like psychological diagnosis, AI systems don’t have emotional understanding. This makes it hard for them to grasp subtle feelings or complicated situations. As a result, their advice may not be very accurate, and they may struggle to show genuine empathy, which can impact the success of treatment.

Part 2: Heuristic Evaluation

## Heuristic Evaluation (1)
### Government of Canada Website

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13eb4de2-e994-4575-bb2f-443360552cff)


## Name
- Government of Canada Website: Applying for various Application (Study Permit for Demo in picture)

## Problem/Good
- Overwhelming Text
- Confusing Application Process

## Relevant Heuristic
- #1 – Visibility of System Status
- #8 – Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

## Evidence of issue
- Large amount of text on the guideline for application pages, but it create more confusion and bury important instructions.
- No clear, ambiguous options. No clear button for start the right application; users can unknowingly apply for the wrong application (like me).

## Detailed explanation (max 100 words)
- Websites contain a lot of text. While these details may be necessary, users tend to get lost in the overabundance of information, and the problem is exacerbated by the fact that many of the applications are from people abroad. Thus skipping important instructions or misunderstanding steps. And even if the important instructions and steps are actually read. But there is no corresponding clear button to start the application after logging in. It is easy to choose the wrong application form due to the lack of clear instructions for each step, unclear labeling and confusing guidance. Users often realize the error months later, leading to expiration.

## Severity (minor, major, critical)
- 4 - Critical

## Justification (max 240 words; 60 words each)
- Frequency
  - The problem is always there, especially because policies will change all the time no matter what the application is, and these issues get more and more complicated as they continue to change. It may be that with this year's policy all the processes are learned but next year they may change.
- Impact
  - Too much text violates the principles of minimalist design. This can lead to serious errors. And without a visible button to initiate an application, users can't easily know what they're applying for, leading to costly errors or delays.
- Persistence
  - I think as a government website, it deserves to be taken seriously, so I don't think overcome it is hard. It should add more organized information to help users understand faster and give applicants a quick grasp on finding the information they need. Implementing clear links to start the application, progress bars and labeled steps would prevent confusion, reduce user ambiguity and maintain trust in government services.
- Weighting
  - I think its very important as a Canadian government website with so many important individual applications, because For example, for international students, the study permit determines whether or not they will be able to continue their studies in Canada. So fixing this would help a lot of like international students and so on.

## Heuristic Evaluation (2)
### Gosfu

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4895a01a-e527-44f9-ab4b-1ce42e5e3d32)

## Name
- Gosfu

## Problem/Good
- Poor Layout
- Connectivity Disruptions

## Relevant Heuristic
- #1 – Visibility of System Status
- #8 – Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

## Evidence of issue
- Buttons are too small and clustered; significant unused whitespace on the right side. Frequent server or network issues prevent students from accessing.

## Detailed explanation (max 100 words)
- This design includes narrow button positions and large blank areas, making it difficult for users to quickly locate functions, and the wasted screen space highlights the irrationality of web design planning. Optimizing the layout and properly resizing buttons can simplify navigation and improve the overall user experience. More importantly, frequent connection interruptions can interrupt critical tasks such as course selection.

## Severity (minor, major, critical)
- 3 - major

## Justification (max 240 words; 60 words each)
- Frequency
For the Poor Layout, it always there. For the Connectivity Disruptions issue, it will occur when there are a lot of users that are requesting. For example, when the people start to enroll in classes on gosfu, and that's probably the most important time of using gosfu. 

- Impact
For the Poor Layout, too many interactive elements and unused space can hinder effective navigation and understanding. For the Connectivity Disruptions issue, it is especially the class enrollment period; if people can't enroll in their planned class, they have to wait for the waitlist. Many people may have to replan their course plan because sometimes people can't enroll in the course due to the popularity of the class.

- Persistence
For the Poor Layout, it will be always there if there no update. For the Connectivity Disruptions issue, this issue may not be resolved unless there is a better server or something. In the current condition, either It might be possible to put different people in different time slots, but it wouldn't solve the problem because the sequencing would lead to unfairness.

- Weighting
I think the Poor Layout issue is not that important. I believe an update for a balanced layout with appropriately sized and spaced buttons will enhance more users experience on the website, but on the other hand, I think the connectivity disruption issue is kind of important because courses in a major are cumulative. Many courses have prerequisites. If one got pushed down to the next term, a series of course plan will be affected.

# Task 2: Github Video + Questions
---
## Q1

Normally, the master branch will represent the stable version of the code. It will be the code that will be released or published. The reason for having a different branch on GitHub is because the other branch is for trying new features and codes, for preventing it from messing up the code, so the branch is the "isolated environment" for testing new features, and until it is stable, then merge with the master branch.

---

## Q2

The first one is to use the code git branch "name", which is the name of the branch at the end, and then a new branch was added at the current status. But now the head is still on the master branch. For a move to the new branch, then we have to use the code git checkout "name". Now the head is on the new branch. The second way is kind of the same but it merged two steps into one code, git checkout -b "name". The -b means "create a new branch." Since the code is checkout, so it checks out to the new branch.

## Q3

   - `git checkout -b test`

This code will create a new branch called "test", and move the head on the new "test" branch because the head was on the "develop" branch so that the new "test" branch will be based on the "develop" branch's current state.
     
   - `git checkout develop`

The current head is on the new "test" branch. By calling this code, it will move the head to the "develop" branch. Which the working directory will reflect whatever the “develop” branch currently looks like.
     
   - `git branch -D test`

This command will “force delete” the "test" branch because -D means it will remove the branch even if it has unmerged commits. After this, the "test" branch will no longer exist.
